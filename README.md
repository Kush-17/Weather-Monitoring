# Weather Monitoring System

Welcome to the **Weather Monitoring System**, a real-time weather application that fetches, stores, and displays weather data for various cities. This application allows users to search for a city and view its current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and other essential weather parameters. The application uses modern web technologies to provide an interactive and responsive user interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data:** Fetches current weather conditions using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **City Search Functionality:** Users can search for any city and retrieve its weather data instantly.
- **Data Storage:** Weather data is stored in Firebase, ensuring that information is readily accessible.
- **Dynamic Updates:** The UI updates dynamically to show weather conditions without needing to refresh the page.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be visually appealing on various devices, with a clean and modern UI.

## Technologies Used

**Weather Monitoring System** utilizes a variety of technologies for both the frontend and backend. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

### Frontend

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)**: A library for writing CSS-in-JS, enabling the creation of styled React components.
- **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the API.

### Backend

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)**: A web application framework for Node.js to build APIs.
- **[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)**: A service for fetching weather data.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: A platform for developing mobile and web applications, providing a real-time NoSQL database for storing weather data.

## üîß Firebase Configuration

To set up Firebase for this application, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click on "Add Project" and follow the prompts to create a new project.

2. **Set Up Firestore:**
   - In your Firebase project, navigate to the Firestore Database section.
   - Click on "Create Database" and follow the setup instructions to create a Firestore database.

3. **Get Firebase Configuration:**
   - In your project settings, find the "Firebase SDK snippet" section and select "Config."
   - Copy the configuration details, which look something like this:
     ```javascript
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "your_api_key",
       authDomain: "your_project_id.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "your_project_id",
       storageBucket: "your_project_id.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "your_messaging_sender_id",
       appId: "your_app_id"
     };
     ```
   - This configuration is essential for connecting your application to Firebase.

## üåç OpenWeatherMap API Configuration

1. **Create an OpenWeatherMap Account:**
   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and create an API key.

2. **API Key Usage:**
   - Use the obtained API key to authenticate requests to the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data.
     ```plaintext
     OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
     ```

## üîë Environment Variables

For security reasons, sensitive information such as API keys and configuration settings should be stored in environment variables. In your project, create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following contents:

```plaintext
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
FIREBASE_CONFIG='your_firebase_config'
PORT=your_port(i have used 3001)
```
